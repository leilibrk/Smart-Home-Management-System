# Smart-Home-Management-System
This is my final project in the Logical Circuits course. In this project we designed a Smart Home Management System.
At first we consider some basic inputs like temperature sensor, combustion sensor and monoxide carbon sensor which send the data to the control center and display proper warnings.
Then, according to the received datas, the cooling-heating system is turned on. Also, depending on whether it is day or night and the amount of light, the number of lamps and the close/open status of shutters is set up.
